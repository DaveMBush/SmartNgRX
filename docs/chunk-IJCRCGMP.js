We could add rows to any SmartNgRX row, but we've kept the demo simple.</p><p class="ngde">We kick off the add process in our <a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/main/apps/demo-ngrx-classic/src/app/shared/components/tree/tree.component.html#L100-L113" class="ngde">template file</a> by calling <code class="ngde">addChild()</code> specifying the current node and the type of child we want to add. Your code may only need to pass the current node. This will always be the parent of the new row.</p><p class="ngde">Since this is a new row, we set the <code class="ngde">editingContent</code> field to a default string that the end user can edit. More work is done in our <a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/main/apps/demo-ngrx-classic/src/app/shared/components/tree/tree-component.service.ts#L115-L127" class="ngde">TreeComponentService.addChild()</a> method that determines if the node needs to be expanded and adds the row to our state (but does not send it to the server). The remainder of the code in the <code class="ngde">tree.component.ts</code> file is to keep track of what we are doing in the view so that repaints don't disrupt the user's experience.</p><p class="ngde">All the child arrays in SmartNgRX are of type <code class="ngde ng-doc-code-with-link"><a href="internal-api/interfaces/internal-api/SmartArray" class="ng-doc-code-anchor ngde">SmartArray</a></code>. We've <a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/main/apps/demo-ngrx-classic/src/app/shared/components/tree/common-source-node.interface.ts#L10" class="ngde">typed the array as a SmartArray</a> so we can access the <code class="ngde">addToStore()</code>, <code class="ngde">getIdAtIndex()</code>, and <code class="ngde">removeFromStore()</code> methods.</p><p class="ngde">Similar to the edit process, <code class="ngde">ESC</code> calls <code class="ngde">cancelEdit()</code> and <code class="ngde">ENTER</code> calls <code class="ngde">saveNode()</code>. <code class="ngde">cancelEdit()</code> just sets things back to the way they were <a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/main/apps/demo-ngrx-classic/src/app/shared/components/tree/tree-component.service.ts#L149-L151" class="ngde">including removing the new node from the store</a>.</p><p class="ngde"><a href="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/main/apps/demo-ngrx-classic/src/app/shared/components/tree/tree.component.ts#L135-L144" class="ngde">saveNode() is also similar</a>. But now you know why we have fields mentioning adding. Under the hood, SmartNgRX knows this is a row that needs to be added and ends up calling your Effects Service method to make that happen.</p>`,e=class e extends a{constructor(){super();this.pageType="guide";this.pageContent=b;this.editSourceFileUrl="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/edit/main/apps/documentation/src/app/ngrx-demo-walkthrough/adding-rows/index.md?message=docs(): describe your changes here...";this.viewSourceFileUrl="https://github.com/DaveMBush/SmartNgRX/blob/release/apps/documentation/src/app/ngrx-demo-walkthrough/adding-rows/index.md";this.page=o;this.demoAssets=h}};e.\u0275fac=function(t){return new(t||e)},e.\u0275cmp=r({type:e,selectors:[["ng-doc-page-mwndzlns"]],features:[g([{provide:a,useExisting:e},l,o.providers??[]]),c],decls:1,vars:0,template:function(t,S){t&1&&i(0,"ng-doc-page")},dependencies:[p],encapsulation:2,changeDetection:0});var n=e,v=[d(s({},(0,u.isRoute)(o.route)?o.route:{}),{path:"",component:n,title:"Adding Rows"})],U=v;export{n as PageComponent,U as default};
