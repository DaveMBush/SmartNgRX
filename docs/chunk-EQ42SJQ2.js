It not only supports CRUD but also implements optimistic UI for updates and deletes.

This made retrieving the entire data set practically impossible and required that we not only use virtual scrolling to render the data but also use a concept of virtual data where we only retrieved the data that was needed to render the current view.</p><p class="ngde">Fast forward to a similar situation and a lot more experience. One of the issues with the previous implementation was that I had to retrieve the data every time it scrolled into view. As you can imagine, even with the fastest retrieval times, this didn't paint nearly as fast as anyone would have liked. This time, we had more control over the data. It was still a large data set. But it was not infinite.</p><p class="ngde">As we were in a meeting one day with everyone discussing various ways would could make the application perform better, I said, "Let me tell you what I've been thinking about." I proceeded to lay out a concept based on my earlier work where we'd only load the rows as we needed them AND remove them once we had some assurance they were no longer being used.</p><p class="ngde">I was then told to go work on a POC for that concept and got far enough to know I was on to something but not far enough to solve all the issues we were going to run into.</p><p class="ngde">Meanwhile, new management came in that talked the original manager out of working on this at this time and I was told to work on other things. I'm not complaining. While I wish I could have continued working on this, this was the right decision for the company.</p><p class="ngde">Now, I couldn't let it go. I kept thinking about it. And another thought came to mind. If we always use essentially the same Actions, Effects and Reducers for each entity, could we just create factory methods that would generate them for us? And if we could do that, could we hide the bulk of what is NgRX from the developer?</p><p class="ngde">At this point, I merged the two concepts. Using the main library of this project, you can register your NgRX entities in a providers section and then use "SmartSelectors" to join the data back together again. Only the join doesn't just join the data, it retrieves the data as it is accessed.</p><p class="ngde">Have a look at our "Ultimate Goals" to see where we are headed and how much we've completed so far.</p><h2 id="documentation" class="ngde">Documentation<a title="Link to heading" class="ng-doc-header-link ngde" href="/home#documentation"><ng-doc-icon icon="link-2" size="16" class="ngde"></ng-doc-icon></a></h2><p class="ngde">All the documentation can be found at <a href="https://davembush.github.io/SmartNgRX/" class="ngde">SmartNgRX Documentation</a></p><h2 id="how-to-run-the-main-projects" class="ngde">How to run the main projects<a title="Link to heading" class="ng-doc-header-link ngde" href="/home#how-to-run-the-main-projects"><ng-doc-icon icon="link-2" size="16" class="ngde"></ng-doc-icon></a></h2><h3 id="prerequisites" class="ngde">Prerequisites<a title="Link to heading" class="ng-doc-header-link ngde" href="/home#prerequisites"><ng-doc-icon icon="link-2" size="16" class="ngde"></ng-doc-icon></a></h3><ul class="ngde"><li class="ngde"><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" class="ngde">NodeJS</a> - ^18.10.0 || ^20.0.0</li><li class="ngde"><a href="https://pnpm.io/" class="ngde">pnpm</a> - ^8</li></ul><h3 id="steps" class="ngde">Steps<a title="Link to heading" class="ng-doc-header-link ngde" href="/home#steps"><ng-doc-icon icon="link-2" size="16" class="ngde"></ng-doc-icon></a></h3><ul class="ngde"><li class="ngde">Checkout the project</li><li class="ngde">Run <code class="ngde">pnpm i</code></li><li class="ngde">start the server with <code class="ngde">pnpm run start:server</code></li><li class="ngde">start the client with <code class="ngde">pnpm run start</code></li><li class="ngde">open a browser to <code class="ngde">http://localhost:4200</code></li></ul><ng-doc-blockquote class="ngde"><p class="ngde">[!NOTE] If you get an error about file watcher running out of file handles, you may need to increase the number of file handles available to the system.
