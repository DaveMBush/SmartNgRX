It also overrides the times to 2 minutes and 4 minutes. Instead of refreshing the data every 2 minutes, it does nothing. Later on, it removes the row if it hasn't been rendered 2 minutes after the last time it would have been marked dirty. While it doesn't refresh when it is marked dirty, it does act as though it did.markDirtyTime: Marks a row as dirty every 2 minutes.markDirtyFetchesNew: Sets this value to false. This is what causes the \"No Refresh\".removeTime: Removes a row from memory if it is still dirty 2 minutes after being marked dirty.Tree (No Remove): This demo does not remove rows from memory once they've been loaded, but it does mark them dirty so they can be refreshed. You might use this feature if your application does not display a lot of data and can support the extra memory preasure. It can also make your application feel faster so you might strategically apply it to select entities in your appliction.markDirtyTime: Marks a row dirty every 2 minutes.removeTime: This is set to 0 so rows are never removed from memory.Tree (No Dirty): This demo sets the markDirtyTime to -1 so that nothing ever gets marked dirty. This means that data will never be refreshed and it will never be removed from memory.

The second is that you can mark the data dirty due to a websocket message event that indicates a row needs to be refreshed. Our API for handling websocket messages does this for you. Whenever data is marked dirty, Smart NgRX will automatically reload the data if it is currently being used or, later,when it is needed.
