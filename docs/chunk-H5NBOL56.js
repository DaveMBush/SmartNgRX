If the row is still being used somewhere on the screen, the system will re-request the row from the server. If the row is not being used, 15 minutes later, the row will be removed from the store. Said another way, if a row is loaded and then not used for 30 minutes, it will be removed from the store.</p><p class="ngde">Up until now we haven't even mentioned Mark and Delete because it is the default.

Maybe you want to mark a row as dirty after 5 minutes instead of 15. Maybe you want rows to be deleted after an hour instead of 30 minutes.
