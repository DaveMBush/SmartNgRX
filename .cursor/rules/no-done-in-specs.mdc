description: Prevent the use of the 'done()' callback in *.spec.ts files. Use async/await or Promises for asynchronous tests instead. This ensures more reliable, readable, and modern test code.

Rule:

- Do not use the 'done' callback in any test or helper function in *.spec.ts files.
- Prefer async/await or returning a Promise for handling asynchronous code in tests.
- Refactor existing tests to remove 'done' and use async/await or Promises.
- This applies to all test files matching *.spec.ts.
