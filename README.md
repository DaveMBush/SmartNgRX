# DynamicNgrxTest

This is a project that demonstrates creating NgRX Actions, Reducers and Effects dynamically.

I'm just starting out and plan to embellish this into a very opinionated framework that will eliminate most of the boiler plate code that is required to create NgRX Actions, Reducers and Effects and will do most of the dispatching for you.  Leaving you to setup the selectors to join your data together and leaving all the state management details to the framework.
